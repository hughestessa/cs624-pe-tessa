PE01 hello world - Tessa Hughes

Description: This app displays threes lines of hard-coded text on a yellow background. It uses five React Native components (1 View, 3 Text, and StyleSheet). 

# INPUT
There is no input from the user. All text is hard-coded.

# PROCESS
There is no processing or calculations, as there is no input from the user.

# OUTPUT
The output is three lines of text with a yellow background. 

## STEPS PERFORMED
I created a new repo for the PE exercises. I then added the instructors as collaborators to my repo. Next, I created a folder called pe01-helloworld, and added a readme file in that folder. I created a new app in that folder called pe01helloworld. I updated the app.js file to add the 3 lines of text and to change the background to yellow. I then viewed the results on Expo Go. Lastly, I committed all my changes.
