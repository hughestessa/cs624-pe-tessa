# INPUT
The input for this app is two-fold. Users can firstly submit a list of 'to-do' items. Once the items are submitted and saved, the users has the option to mark an item complete, or to delete an item completly.

# PROCESS
There is no processing of the textual data. The todo items are entered by the user, and the entered text is simply added as an item in the array of to-dos. If a users chooses to 'Delete' a to-do item, it will get deleted from the array of to-do items. And if the users marks an item as 'Done' the to-do item in the array of to-do items is updated accordingingly.

# OUTPUT
The output for this app is
1. A list of submitted to-do items
2. Two buttons to mark each to-do item as 'Done' or to 'Delete' and item.
3. Three tabs where the list of to-do items can be filtered to show either 'All', 'Active' or 'Complete'.

# Additional Analysis
While analyzing the UI for this app, I noted the following UI improvements that could be made to make this app's design better:
1. I would move the "SUBMIT" button to above the list of to-do items. If you have a really long list, the user will not want to have to scroll to the bottom of the list everytime they want to add a new item. Therefore, I think moving the SUMBIT button above the list of to-do items would make more sense.
2. I noticed that if there is a to-do item with a lot of text, the two 'Done' and 'Delete' buttons get squished and seem to disappear. I would like to know how to fix this.
3. I would add a way for the user to enter their name so that the header is personalized. (i.e., "Tessa's To Do List", "Sarah's To Do List")
