# Input
This app displays an image, a text input field, and a list of courses offered at CityU for the MSCS program. The only input from the user is the text answer to the question, "What is your favorite class?"

# Process
There is no processing for this app. Data is not transformed or changed in any way. The list of courses are hard coded. Additionally, the single text-input field from the user is not processed or changed.

# Output
The output for this app is the same as the input for this app. There is an image, the text entered in the text-input field by the user, and a list of courses offered at CityU for the MSCS program.

# Additional Notes
For this exercise, I used these core components: View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet. For the image, I used the CityU logo. For style, I used dark blue and a larger font for the header texts. Additionally, I added some borders and margins to make the screen more appealing.
